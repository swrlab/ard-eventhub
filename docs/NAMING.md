# ARD-Eventhub / Naming Conventions

Several parts of this service require naming conventions that are followed throughout all parts.

## Google Cloud Pub/Sub

Pub/Sub includes a number of restrictions around names, keys and values. For all parts (module, stage, serviceId, etc.), there are some defined rules:

- Keys other than `stage` must never include any value of a staging environment (e.g. `service` cannot include `prod`)
- All values are always written in lower-case characters, without any special chars such as äöü.
  - This service uses a slug converter to turn user-defined institution names into usable but still readable strings
- Google restrictions for IDs:
  - Must be 3-255 characters, start with a letter, and contain only the following characters: letters, numbers, dashes (-), periods (.), underscores (_), tildes (~), percents (%) or plus signs (+). Cannot start with goog.
